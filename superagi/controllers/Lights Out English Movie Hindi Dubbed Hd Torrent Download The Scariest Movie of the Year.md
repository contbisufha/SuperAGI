- The "Dimension" tool lets you add dimension lines and arrows to your project.

## Step 4: Export and print your design
 
When you are happy with your design, you can export it to various formats for further use. You can use the "File" menu to save your project as a PRO100 file or export it as an image (JPG, BMP), a PDF document or a DXF file (for CAD software).
 
You can also print your design using the "Print" menu. You can choose to print either the 3D or 2D view of your project or both. You can also adjust the print settings such as paper size, orientation, scale and margins.
