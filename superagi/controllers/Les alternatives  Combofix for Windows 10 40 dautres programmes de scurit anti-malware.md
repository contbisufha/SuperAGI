ComboFix is a free anti-malware tool that scans your computer for known infections and attempts to remove them automatically. It is a powerful program that can deal with stubborn malware that other programs may miss. However, ComboFix is not compatible with Windows 10 or Windows 8.1, so if you have one of those operating systems, you will need to find an alternative solution.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use ComboFix on Windows 10 40, a custom version of Windows 10 that has been modified to run older programs. This version of Windows 10 is not officially supported by Microsoft, so use it at your own risk. We do not recommend using ComboFix on your main computer, as it may cause damage if used incorrectly. Always backup your important data before using ComboFix.

## Steps to Use ComboFix on Windows 10 40
 
1. Download ComboFix from [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/combofix/), a trusted source for malware removal tools[^1^]. Save the file to your desktop.
2. Disable or close all anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-malware, and real-time protection programs on your computer. These programs may interfere with ComboFix and prevent it from working properly.
3. Turn off all other applications and programs running on your computer. ComboFix will require your full attention and may reboot your computer several times during the process.
4. Double-click on the ComboFix.exe file on your desktop to start the program. You will see a disclaimer window asking you to agree to the terms of use. Read the disclaimer carefully and click Yes if you agree.
5. ComboFix will then check if you have a Windows Recovery Console installed on your computer. This is a feature that allows you to restore your system in case of a problem. If you do not have it, ComboFix will offer to download and install it for you. Click Yes to proceed.
6. ComboFix will then start scanning your computer for malware. This may take some time, depending on the number and severity of infections on your computer. Do not interrupt or interfere with the scan, as this may cause damage to your system.
7. When the scan is complete, ComboFix will display a log file containing the results of the scan and the actions taken by the program. Review the log file carefully and note any infections that were not removed by ComboFix.
8. ComboFix will then ask you to reboot your computer to complete the removal process. Click OK to restart your computer.
9. After rebooting, ComboFix will run another scan to check if there are any remaining infections on your computer. If there are none, you will see a message saying that ComboFix has finished.
10. You can then close ComboFix and delete the ComboFix.exe file from your desktop.

## Tips and Warnings

- ComboFix is a very powerful tool that should only be used by advanced or intermediate users who know what they are doing. Do not use ComboFix unless you are instructed by a trained helper or you are confident in your abilities.
- ComboFix is not a substitute for regular anti-virus or anti-malware programs. You should always have an updated and reliable security program installed on your computer to protect it from malware threats.
- ComboFix may not work on some versions of Windows 10 40, depending on how they have been modified. If you encounter any problems or errors while using ComboFix, stop the program immediately and seek help from a qualified technician.
- ComboFix may delete some legitimate files or programs that are falsely detected as malware. If this happens, you may need to restore them from a backup or reinstall them from their original source.
- ComboFix may cause some changes to your system settings or registry entries that may affect the performance or functionality of your computer. If this happens, you may need to undo these changes manually or use a system restore point to revert them.
